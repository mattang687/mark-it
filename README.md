## Introduction
I love how quickly Markdown allows me to format documents, and I was surprised to find that there weren't any Markdown note taking extensions out there. Here's my take on the perfect note taking extension (for me).

## Key Features
- Replaces the new tab page with your notes
- View and Edit modes allow you to see the pretty version of your notes, but edit them with the full power of Markdown when you need to
- A toolbar popup means you don't have to leave your page to make a quick edit
- All notes are saved instantly and persist between sessions

## Usage
I'm currently in the process of releasing this to the Firefox and Chrome stores, and I'll update the readme as they are released.

To see your notes, open a new tab. The new tab page will default to View mode.

You can also open the popup by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + F` or clicking the toolbar icon. The popup will default to Edit mode.

To switch between View and Edit mode, press `Ctrl + Shift + Space`. If you're on the new tab page, you can also click the button in the bottom left.

That's it! I hope you like it, and please let me know if there's anything I can improve!
