## Introduction

I love how quickly Markdown allows me to format documents, and I was surprised to find that there weren't any Markdown note taking extensions out there. Here's my take on the perfect note taking extension (for me).

## Key Features

- Replaces the new tab page with your notes
- View and Edit modes allow you to see the pretty version of your notes, but edit them with the full power of Markdown when you need to
- A toolbar popup means you don't have to leave your page to make a quick edit
- All notes are saved instantly and persist between sessions

## Usage

Mark-It is available for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mark-it/?src=search) and [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mark-it/pfodanikhbfnlkdaoeppjiijfgpeaglm?hl=en)!

To see your notes, open a new tab. The new tab page will default to View mode.

You can also open the popup by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + F` or clicking the toolbar icon. The popup will default to Edit mode.

To switch between View and Edit mode, press `Ctrl + Shift + Space`, or click on the colored mode switch button.

When you stop typing, your notes are saved automatically, and all instances of your notes are updated.

That's it! I hope you like it, and please let me know if there's anything I can improve!
